/**
 *   This application aims to deliver a client and server which are able to interact
 *  with each other to demonstrate a user input being transfered from a client to server.
 *  A process being carried upon the input given, and an output being returned to the
 *  client system. The client then outputs the response and the application concludes.
 *     
 *   This verison attempts to implement the above in a threaded manner so that
 *   more than one client may access the server at any one time.
